College Metrics is a (not currently served) web app and API that allows users to search for colleges by state or by name. Institution pages include basic metrics and an image sorced from the Bing Images API.

Our API is built from the College Scorecard dataset, a comprehensive higher education database maintained by the U.S. Department of Education.  
Data, analysis, and documentation, including variable descriptions and guides to using the College Scorecard API are available here: ​https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
